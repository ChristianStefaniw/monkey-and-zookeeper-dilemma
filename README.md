## Monkey and Zookeeper Dilemma

We talked about a dilemma related to a zoo keeper trying to feed a monkey in physics class a few days ago and I decided to find two solutions to the problem. The dilemma is there is a zoo keeper who wants to feed a monkey that is hanging on a branch, the zookeeper is using a banana launcher to launch bananas at the monkey. The catch is, when the monkey hears the launcher go off, the monkey falls from its branch. How can the zookeeper feed the monkey?

Option 1:
 - Turn off gravity (quite unrealistic)<br>

 Option 2:
 - Aim the banana launcher at the monkey and fire, both objects will experience the same acceleration so the banana will hit the monkey on the way down! <br>

 Press the space bar to launch a banana!  
 Press "1" to change the gravity and refresh rate

 This was my first time using Pygame
